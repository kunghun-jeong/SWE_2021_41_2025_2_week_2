# License Selection

I selected the **MIT License** for this project.

I chose the MIT License because it is simple, widely used, and gives other users 
the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the code with very few restrictions.  
At the same time, it limits the author's liability, which makes it suitable for 
educational assignments and open-source sharing.
